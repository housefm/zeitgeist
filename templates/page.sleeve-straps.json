Fabric sleeve straps can also be challenging to fasten and hard to clean effectively.<p>\n\n<p>So Andrew had an idea: Why not make t-shirt sleeve straps for sports made out of silicone?<\/p>\n\n<p>After many iterations, Andrew and his team came up with ExerTies: hypoallergenic, chafe-free silicone t-shirt scrunchies that keep your sleeves up throughout an entire game — all while abiding by soccer safety <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rulesofsport.com\/sports\/football.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"regulations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regulations<\/a>.<\/p>"
